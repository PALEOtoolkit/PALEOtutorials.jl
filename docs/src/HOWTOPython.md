# Configuring for Julia - python interoperability

Julia interoperability with Python is provided by the [PythonCall.jl](https://github.com/JuliaPy/PythonCall.jl) package in the [JuliaPy](https://github.com/JuliaPy) github organisation. This is now recommended over the earlier [PyCall.jl](https://github.com/JuliaPy/PyCall.jl) package.

See <https://juliapy.github.io/PythonCall.jl/stable/pythoncall/#pythoncall-config> for configuration options to either use an existing python
install from Julia, or to let Julia install it's own copy of python.
